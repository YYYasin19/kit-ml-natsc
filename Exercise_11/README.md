# Week 11 â€“ Generative models (21.06.2020)
Smiles,
Autoencoder,
Application: Drug design
- Generative models to generate synthetic data, e.g. high energy physics
- Silke: GANs to generate energy response of particles at LHC calorimeter -> maybe too hard to train
- Silke: Minimal example
- Liza: GANs to predict next step. but maybe thats also good for LSTM+CNN https://github.com/alokwhitewolf/Video-frame-prediction-by-multi-scale-GAN

Matthias
- GANs: LHC from Silke, or particles from Alexander Stroh et al.
